# Crop-Yield-Prediction


<h2>Description</h2>
Designed and developed a full-stack web application to predict agricultural crop yields based on user-input parameters such as crop type, season, geographical state, year, area, rainfall, fertilizer usage, and pesticide application.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

- Machine Learning Integration: Trained and deployed regression models using historical crop data to estimate yields (kg/ha) with crop-specific thresholds.
- Backend (Flask): Built a RESTful API using Flask to handle model inference, including preprocessing pipelines and label encoding via joblib.
- Frontend (React): Developed an interactive user interface allowing farmers and researchers to input data and instantly receive yield predictions.
- Data Sources: Utilized a curated dataset (crop_yield.csv) for model training and validation.
- Tools & Technologies: Python, Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Joblib, Git.

<h2>Impact</h2>

- Aimed at supporting farmers and agricultural planners in making data-driven decisions to optimize crop production and resource allocation.
